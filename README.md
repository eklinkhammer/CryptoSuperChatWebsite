# CryptoSuperChatWebsite
Two static page templates - one for streaming overlay and one for donations.

## Usage
As part of the ```CreateStreamer``` API, these templates will be copied from their S3 locations, modified with the streamer information, and stored in a dedicated S3 bucket.

## Upload
Currently - copy and paste into S3 bucket. TODO - have CDK zip the asset and upload.
